# Bastos_et_al

This repository contains the code, used for analyzing the snRNAseq data of mouse fetal liver and adult bone marrow monocytes in Bastos et al. (Monocytes can efficiently replace all brain macrophages and instruct different microglial identities depending on their origin , Immunity, 2025)

### Code
  - 1.snATACseq_data_preprocessing.Rmd - code for data preprocessing, QC and clustering of the combined bone marrow and fetal liver dataset
  - 2.snATACseq_FL_subset.Rmd - code for analysing the fetal liver subset of the dataset, including nuclei classification based on a scRNAseq dataset of the same biological samples
  - 3.snATACseq_BM_subset.Rmd - code for analysing the bone marrow subset of the dataset, including nuclei classification based on a scRNAseq dataset of the same biological samples
  - 4.snATACseq_TF-accessibility_ChromVar.Rmd - code for inferring transcription-factor-associated accessibility in the fetal liver monocyte dataset using ChromVar
